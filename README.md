# MidtermProject

## Overview
#### This is an app designed to create lost & found board for missing pets.  Users can create an account, create a pet profile for their pets, create a post alerting that the pet is missing, and comment on their posts and other users' posts.

## Technologies Used
* Java
* MySQL
* MySQL Workbench
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Spring Tools Suite
* Git
* GitHub
* Gradle
* SpringBoot
* Trello
* Agile (Scrum)


## Lessons Learned
* Organizing User Stories and To-Dos from User Stories
* JSession implementation for user login
* Controllers and DAOs for each entity to help in organization, concurrent team work, and avoiding merge conflicts
* MySQL Workbench deleted database inserts. Pulling the mwb file from a branch that had not pulled yet allowed us to refill the database inserts
* Debugging takes a LOONNG time
* Clear directions on todos

## How To Use
* User is prompted to create an account or log in to an existing account
* Logged in user can toggle the navbar for Account, Pet, Post, Search, or Sign out.
* The navbar presents drop down menus that allow the user to perform CRUD operations on their User data, Contact data, Post data, Location data, Pet data, and Pet Photo data.
